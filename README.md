This is a development of my discord bot, Aera. It is a moderation bot that can purge, ban, kick etc. Hope you enjoy the bot.

For this bot to work, it be the highest ranked member. Meaning no other member should have higher perms than this bot.

I added some files to the .gitignore files. Due to this, I would just like to add in the README.md that the __pycache__ folder and its Cpython files (.cpy) have not been added. Also, cogs have been added to make this bot more efficient. Lastly, I have also started including my own custom help bot.
